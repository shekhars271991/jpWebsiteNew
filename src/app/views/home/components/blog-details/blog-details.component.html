            <p>We all know, by heart and soul, that health is the ultimate wealth and good food leads to
                good health.

                But in our busy lives we donâ€™t really get a chance to eat good always, especially
                because of the time constraints. In those cases, we must resort to eating food cooked in
                dirty kitchens.
            </p>
            <p>However restraunts dont really care about the hygiene as they believe in profits and only
                profits.</p>
